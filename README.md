# Use the cheatsheets locally

Run the `setup.sh` script to call each cheatsheet without a path. <br>
If you want to use a certain text editor instead of using just `cat`, <br>
then remember to edit the bash script accordingly.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChronosPK/pentesting-cheatsheets.git
cd pentesting-cheatsheet
sudo bash setup.sh
```

```bash
common-enum
common-revshells
```
