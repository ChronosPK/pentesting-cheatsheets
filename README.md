# Use the cheatsheets locally

Run the `setup.sh` script to call each cheatsheet without a path. <br>  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChronosPK/pentesting-cheatsheets.git
cd pentesting-cheatsheet
sudo ./setup.sh
```
If you want to view the cheatsheets using a certain file editor like `subl`, <br>
give the absolute path of the editor as a script argument.
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh /usr/bin/subl
```
Enjoy the new commands! 
```bash
common-enum
common-revshells
# ...
```
