# Use the cheatsheets locally

Create an executable for each cheatsheet file to read its contents. <br>
You will be able to call them without specifying the full path. <br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChronosPK/pentesting-cheatsheets.git
```


```bash
cat << EOF > calling_name_for_cheatsheet
#!/bin/bash
cat /location/to/cheatsheet-name
EOF
```
```bash
sudo mv calling_name_for_cheatsheet /usr/bin/   # you will be able to call the file from anywhere
sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/calling_name_for_cheatsheet
```
