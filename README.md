## Here I keep updating my repository of cheatsheets handy in pentests and CTFs


Among these, I have also created many writeups, templates, tricks and tools and scripts on my personal website, https://chronossec.site
( Since I want only the people who are really interested in my work to visit my site, it is password protected - **chronos-security** )


### Paths to check:

Pentest Cheatsheets: https://chronossec.site/s/cheatsheets/pentest-enumertation

Certification prep boxes and templates: https://chronossec.site/s/writeups/cert-prep/

Tricks and tools: https://chronossec.site/s/cheatsheets/trick-and-tools

CTFs writeups: https://chronossec.site/s/writeups/ctfs/

TryHackMe Writeups: https://chronossec.site/s/writeups/tryhackme

HackTheBox Writeups: https://chronossec.site/s/writeups/hackthebox

Forensics and steganography: https://chronossec.site/s/cheatsheets/forensics-and-steg



Keep in mind that I keep updating and working on my projects everyday, so nothing reached it's final form.

### With all that being said, enjoy!
